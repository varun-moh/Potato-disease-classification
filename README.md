# 🌱 Potato Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

🚀 This project leverages deep learning to identify potato plant diseases from images. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and the [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.plantvillage.org/), the model is trained to classify images into multiple classes with high accuracy.

## 📂 Project Structure  

- **Dataset**: The project uses images from the PlantVillage dataset.
- **Model Architecture**:  
  - Multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction  
  - Max pooling layers for dimensionality reduction  
  - Fully connected dense layers for classification

## ⚙️ Model Overview  

The architecture is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras:  

```python
model = models.Sequential([
    resize_and_rescale,
    data_augmetation,
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(n_classes, activation='softmax')
])
```

### Key Details:
- **Input Shape**: `(BATCH_SIZE, IMAGE_SIZE, IMAGE_SIZE, CHANNELS)`
